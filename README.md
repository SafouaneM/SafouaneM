# Hey
- 👋 I’m @SafouaneM
- 👀 I’m interested in creating projects that will eventually help other people with their problems
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my Javascript knowledge, and I'm trying to develop my other skills to the next level by attending a minor
- 🍂 As of 01-11-2022 I'll be working on a new project stay tuned, this time I'll actually finish it 😉
