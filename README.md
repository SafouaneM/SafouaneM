# Hey
- 👋 I’m @SafouaneM
- 👀 I’m interested in creating projects that will eventually help other people with their problems
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my Javascript knowledge, and I'm trying to develop my other skills to the next level by attending a minor
- 🍂 As of 07-09-2023 I'll be working on a new project stay tuned, this time together with a class mate. Follow the project status here https://github.com/users/SafouaneM/projects/1/views/1
